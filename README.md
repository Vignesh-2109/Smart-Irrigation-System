WHAT IS SMART IRRIGATION?
Smart irrigation technology
uses soil moisture data to
determine the irrigation need
of the landscape.
HOW IoT AND ML IS USED FOR SMART IRRIGATION?
Sensors and a microcontroller can be used to supply the needed amount of water at the
right moment.
The microcontroller can receive input from the sensor data.
The irrigation operation can be managed and controlled by microcontroller.
By considering the amount of soil moisture of land it can be implemented in an
automated watering system.
With various tools and a prediction model, machine learning can be used to schedule
irrigation.
USE OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS
Machine Learning(ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence(AI) that are classified into supervised
learning, unsupervised learning.
KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree belong to the supervised category,
which makes prediction based on labeled data set.
Here we Use Machine Learning Algorithms to analyse the sensor data and predict whether the
plant needs to be watered or not.
Many Algorithms like Decision Tree,Random Forest,KNN were used for the analysis of the data but
the results were better when we used Logistic Regression to predict.
As we get the data from the sensors to the cloud,the data is analysed by the Algorithm.
We have Used Logistic Regression for the analysis of data.
