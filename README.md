Smart Irrigation System
What is Smart Irrigation?
Smart irrigation technology uses soil moisture data to determine the irrigation needs of the landscape. By leveraging advanced sensors and microcontrollers, smart irrigation systems ensure that the right amount of water is supplied at the right moment.

How IoT and ML are Used for Smart Irrigation?
Sensors and Microcontrollers: Sensors collect soil moisture data, which is sent to a microcontroller. The microcontroller manages and controls the irrigation process based on the received sensor data.
Automated Watering System: By considering the soil moisture levels, the system can automate the watering process, ensuring optimal irrigation.
Machine Learning for Scheduling: Using various tools and prediction models, machine learning (ML) can be employed to schedule irrigation effectively.
Use of Machine Learning Algorithms
Machine Learning (ML), a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI), can be categorized into supervised and unsupervised learning.

Supervised Learning: Includes algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree. These algorithms make predictions based on labeled datasets.
Application in Smart Irrigation: ML algorithms analyze sensor data to predict whether plants need watering.
Analysis and Prediction
Multiple algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN, were tested for data analysis. However, Logistic Regression provided the best results for prediction.
Sensor data is transmitted to the cloud, where it is analyzed by the chosen algorithm.
Logistic Regression: Used for analyzing the data, offering better accuracy in predicting the irrigation needs.
